These are some of my simple web development projects to start my web development journey in april, 2024. 

Spoonacular Kitchen: This is an tailwind css web app that was built by me to search and get recipes from the spoonacular api.

Password Manager: It is a password manager that saves,edits,delete and read  the passwords from the mongodb database hosted on the atlas.

Magnet Brains Clone: it is an project that i left after being busy, basically it's a clone of magnetbrains.com

Note:You are free to copy,fork and use these projects as these aren't worth much to me but can be for someone else.
